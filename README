This is my ESC[1] for my imaginary Quad Helicopter. It contains a
microcontroller that controls 4 brushless engines without sensors.

The firmware is supposed to be used from another controller unit and
communicate over SPI.

Specification/goals:
- Capable of driving 30A engines
- SPI protocol for controlling engines
- Support giving feedback from ADCs

Possible future projects/extensions:
- Support RC PWM as an input signal
